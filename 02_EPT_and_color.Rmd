# Elementary Percepual Tasks

* Some Visual tasks are easier than others.

## Groupings

The way we organize our graphics can lead a viewer to create mental groups of marks.

* Enclosures
* Connections
* Proximity
* Similarity (color/shape)


Example: Warpbreaks
While spinning wool into thread, if the tension on the wool isn't correctly set, the thread can break. Here we compare two different types of wool at three different tensions.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
means <- warpbreaks %>% group_by(tension, wool) %>% 
  summarize(breaks=mean(breaks))
                                                              
ggplot( warpbreaks, aes(x=tension, y=breaks, shape=wool)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle( "Can't easily distiguish wool types.")
  
ggplot( warpbreaks, aes(x=tension, y=breaks, shape=wool, color=wool)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle( "Can't see the trend.")

ggplot( warpbreaks, aes(x=tension, y=breaks, color=wool)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape=wool)) +
  geom_line(data=means, aes(x=as.numeric(tension), y=breaks)) +
  ggtitle( "Adding connections between means, the trend is clear")

ggplot( warpbreaks, aes(x=tension, y=breaks, color=wool)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape=wool)) +
  geom_line(data=means, aes(x=as.numeric(tension), y=breaks)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ wool) +
  ggtitle( "Trend is clear, but magnitude is harder")
```


## "Color" Scales

Defining Color really has three different attributes (From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV)).

### HSV Scale
* Hue: The attribute of a visual sensation according to which an area appears to be similar to one of the perceived colors: red, yellow, green, and blue, or to a combination of two of them.
* Saturation: The "colorfulness of a stimulus relative to its own brightness"
* Value: The "brightness relative to the brightness of a similarly illuminated white"

![HSV Cylinder from Wikipedia](./Resources/Wikipedia/HSV_color_solid_cylinder_saturation_gray.png)

* Hue is appropriate for categorical variables.
* Saturation and/or Value is approriate for a quantitative variable scale.

Neither R nor Tableau make it particularly easy to map these aspects, so we won't get too deep into it.
