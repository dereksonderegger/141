### Assignments{-}

1. Read Chapter 6 and 7 from Claus Wilke's Fundamentals of Data Visualiztion [book](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/).

2. Watch Hans Roslings [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen). Comment on two aspects of the videa that stand out to you regarding how he presented his data and how he talked through the visualization with the audience.

3. Graph the NOAA CO$_2$ data over time.  The Nationa Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration has monthly CO$_2$ atmospheric levels data available to the public at NOAA's [website](ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt). However, this is a little obnoxious to get into Tableau, so I've done some data wrangling for you [already](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dereksonderegger/141/master/data-raw/CO2.csv). The `Date2` column has the date information encoded using a continuous decimal scale. CO$_2$ is measured in parts per million.

    a) Plot CO$_2$ over time while showing the monthly trend. Should we use area or lines?  Why?
    b) Create a graph that shows a single mark per year (so average over all observations in a year). Do you like this better? Explain your reasoning.
    c) Create a follow-up graphic that shows the monthly trend. Explain what you want to demonstrate and why you chose to display the information as you did.
    




## Visualizing Amounts

The 2020 presidential candidate field has a wide range of ages. 
The 
[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/09/us/politics/2020-democractic-candidates-ages.html)
has a nice article showing the candidate ages. I grabbed a few of the most prominent candidates and pulled their birthdays from Wikipedia and then calculated their age on election day.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=5}
birth <- read_csv('data-raw/Prez_Candidate_Birthdays')
ggplot(birth, aes(x=Candidate, y=AgeOnElection)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x='Candidate', y='Age on Nov 3,  2020', title='Ages of Presidential Candidates') +
  coord_flip()
```

The order of the candidates is useless. Here we have ordered them alphabetically when we should try to think about an ordering that improves clarity. Lets switch to sorting the candidates by age.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=5}
birth <- birth %>%
  mutate(Candidate = fct_reorder(Candidate, AgeOnElection))  
ggplot(birth, aes(x=Candidate, y=AgeOnElection, color=Party)) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values=c('Blue','Red')) +
  labs(x='Candidate', y='Age on Nov 3,  2020', title='Ages of Presidential Candidates') +
  coord_flip()
```

This isn't too bad, but it fails to visually impress the differences. A bar chart should visually impress the ages based on the length of the bar so that we con't have to keep looking at the Age axis.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=5}
birth %>%
  mutate(Candidate = fct_reorder(Candidate, AgeOnElection))  %>%
ggplot( aes(x=Candidate, y=AgeOnElection, fill=Party)) + 
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c('Blue','Red')) +
  labs(x='Candidate', y='Age on Nov 3,  2020', title='Ages of Presidential Candidates') +
  coord_flip()
```

What would be *dishonest* is if we were to chop off the bars at 35 or 40 to make the age difference between Buttigieg and Warren, Trump, Biden and Sanders seem huge.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=5}
birth <- birth %>%
  mutate(candidate = fct_reorder(Candidate, AgeOnElection))  
ggplot(birth, aes(x=Candidate, y=AgeOnElection, fill=Party)) + 
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c('Blue','Red')) +
  labs(x='Candidate', y='Age on Nov 3,  2020', title='Ages of Presidential Candidates - WRONG!') +
  coord_flip(ylim=c(35,80)) 
```


Often we need to graph some value and want to know how it varies among *two* different categories. In these cases, we have to employ some sort of grouping strategy.

```{r}
data('gapminder', package='gapminder')
G7 <- c('United States', 'Canada', 'France', 'United Kingdom', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'Japan')
gapminder <- gapminder %>%
  filter( country %in%  G7) %>%
  mutate( decade = cut(year, breaks = seq(1950, 2010, by=10), right=FALSE, labels = paste(seq(1950,2000,by=10),'s',sep='')))

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, country, decade) %>%
  summarize(lifeExp = median(lifeExp)) %>% 
  filter(decade == '2000s') %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, desc(lifeExp) )) %>%
ggplot(., aes(x=country, y=lifeExp)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title='Life Expectancy among G7 Countries in 2007', y='Life Expectancy')
```

The bar chart here is obscuring the differences in life expectancies because the numbers are so close. In this case, I think points make more sense. Also I want to see how life expectancy has changed since World War II.


```{r}
data('gapminder', package='gapminder')
gapminder <- gapminder %>% filter( country %in%  G7) %>%
  mutate(country = fct_relevel(country, c('Japan','Italy','Canada','France','Germany','United Kingdom', 'United States' )) )

ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line() +
  facet_grid( . ~ country) +
 scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2010,  by=20)) + 
  labs(title='Life Expectancy among G7 Countries (1950 - 2007)', y='Life Expectancy',
       x='') 
```

In the above graph, I am grouping countries both by enclosure and with a physical path connection. The reader tends to see the line as a whole object and compare the line max/min and slope among the seven countries. 

We might consider changing the faceting to stack the countries, but this makes it much harder to compare countries to see which has a higher life expectancy.
```{r}
data('gapminder', package='gapminder')
gapminder <- gapminder %>% filter( country %in%  G7) %>%
  mutate(country = fct_relevel(country, c('Japan','Italy','Canada','France','Germany','United Kingdom', 'United States' )) )

ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line() +
  facet_grid( country ~ . ) +
 scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2010,  by=20)) + 
  labs(title='Life Expectancy among G7 Countries (1950 - 2007)', y='Life Expectancy',
       x='') 
```


A heat map makes it easier to see which country has the highest life expectancy, but we lose precision in the actual values.
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(country = fct_relevel(country, c('Japan','Italy','Canada','France','Germany','United Kingdom', 'United States' )) )%>%
  mutate(country = fct_rev(country)) %>%
ggplot(., aes( x=year, y=country, fill=lifeExp) ) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(midpoint=73) +
  #scale_fill_gradient(low='red', high='blue')
  labs(title='Life Expectancy among G7 Countries (1950 - 2007)', fill='Life Expectancy',
       x='', y='') 
```
