## How to Store Data

Data is commonly stored in spreadsheets.
* Columns are variables of interest
* Rows are observations.

Example: A data set we'll call `iris` which has 150 observations of three species of iris. Each observation measured the length and width of both the petals and sepals.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
head(iris) %>% pander::pander()
```


## Tableau

By dragging variables onto destination
* Scatterplot of the Iris Data
    * Making Species Colors 
    * Making Facets

Modifying how a variable is displayed
* GPAGender
    * Make a Barchart with Gender and # Piercings
    * Turn # of Piercings into a discrete value.
    * Fix Gender Levels.  IFF( [GenderCode] = 1, 'Male', 'Female' )
    * Change the colors associated with each gender.

Reorder categorical variables levels
* Warpbreaks
    * Do breaks vs Wooltype and Tension
    * Reorder the Tension levels to make senese.
