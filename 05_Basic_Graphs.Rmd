# Basic Graphs

* Data Types - Categorical vs Continuous

* 1 Variable
  * Continuous - box plot, smoothed histogram, and histogram
  * Categorical - Bar chart
  * Talk about the summarization obscuring the data and but more clearly showing
  the major points - what is the center, spread, and shape.
  
  
* 2 Variables
  * Both Continuous - Scatter plot.
  * one Categorical one Continuous - 
    * side by side box plots
    * side by side histogram or smoothed histogram
    * stacked histogram (how does this help)?
