The usual map of the world that is shown is highly misleading. Because we have to project a spherical object onto a 2-D plane, we can't do it without distorting the areas. The result is that areas near the north and south poles look much larger than they actually are. This ends up emphasizing high latitude European countries compared to equatorial countries.

Here are the three most commonly used projections:
Equirectangular has an even grid of latitude and logitude lines.

The Robinson projection is a compromise that tries to re-scale land near the poles to be closer to the actual size.

Another compromise is to allow for discontinuities on the map surface. This decreases the amount of distortion, but cleaves Greenland and Antarctica.

I haven't had an opportunity to place my own spin on geographic maps and instead we will look at Claus Wilke's Chapter on [Geographic maps](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/geospatial-data.html).


```{r}
leaflet() %>% 
  setView(lng= -1*(111+37/60+155/3600), lat=35+11/60+57/3600, zoom = 14) %>%
  addTiles()
```

One of the best things about interactive maps is that you can zoom in and out and change the level of resolution. The ability to easily transition between different scale is amazing and is a hallmark of a quality interactive experience.

Google Maps is built on a 256x256 pixel tile system where zoom level 0 is an image of the whole earth. Each zoom step in halves the X and Y range and so shows 1/4 of the surface area. Zoom level 20 is the scale of a single building, level 14 is the zoom level displayed above.
