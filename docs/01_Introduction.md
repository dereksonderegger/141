# Preface {-}


* What is data?
* Why visualize it?
    * See relationships that raw data obscure.
    * Cognitive work to translate raw numbers into context between other data points are already done for you.
    * Good graphics translate particular numerical relationships into physical relationships which our brains are really good at processing.
    

## Examples

* [UK Drug Poison](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/articles/middleagedgenerationmostlikelytodiebysuicideanddrugpoisoning/2019-08-13) These are the data from the UK related to drug overdose and misuse. Farther down the page gives a similar graph on suicide.


* [Migration Patterns in Europe](https://www.torre.nl/EUmoves/).


* While the New York Times is generally really quite good, this [graph](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/world/americas/western-liberal-democracy.html?_r=0) is quite misleading. Another view of the data is more fair, although the still

* I feel compelled to show a bad [3-d Excel graphic](https://consultantjournal.com/blog/use-3d-charts-at-your-own-risk) as well.

## Pedigogical Plan

1. Develop basic understanding and skills about data wrangling. Because this course will require you to find data that interests you, we need to also learn how to manipulate it because the data are *never* in a nice format.

2. Introduce the Elementary Perceptual Task order and understand how certain visual tasks are more accurate than others.

3. Introduce a slew of graphic types and examples of where and how they are commonly used.

4. Investigate the choice of variables to display and how that can influence the graph interpretation.

5. Understand how interactive graphics can be used across a broad audience.
