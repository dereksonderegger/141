# Introduction


## Initial thoughts.

* What is data?
* Why visualize it?
    * See relationships that raw data obscure.
    * Cognative work to translate raw numbers into context between other data points are already done for you.
    * Good graphics translate particular numerical relationships into physical relationships which our brains are really good at processing.
    

## Amazing Graphics

* [UK Drug Poison](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/articles/middleagedgenerationmostlikelytodiebysuicideanddrugpoisoning/2019-08-13) These are the data from the UK related to drug overdose and misuse. Farther down the page gives a similar graph on suicide.


* [Migration Patterns in Europe](https://www.torre.nl/EUmoves/).

## Bad Graphs

* While the New York Times is generally really quite good, this [graph](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/world/americas/western-liberal-democracy.html?_r=0) is quite misleading. Another view of the data is more fair, although the still

* I feel compelled to show a bad [3-d Excel graphic](https://consultantjournal.com/blog/use-3d-charts-at-your-own-risk) as well.


* Reuter's infamous [gun deaths in Florida](https://callingbullshit.org/tools/img/stand_your_ground.png) chart.

* An amusing case where a pie chart is [ridiculous](https://flowingdata.com/2017/03/09/pie-charts-are-okay/). This is the result of a survey that asks what pizza toppings are liked. In particular, a person can pick more than one topping and so the percentages don't sum to 100%.


## Tableau or ???

* [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students#form) is a nice program that reads in data and can produce some very nice graphics and dashboards.  
    * [Licensing Questions?](https://community.tableau.com/docs/DOC-10249) 
    * What are dashboards? A series of related graphs, often with controls that allow you to explore the data.
