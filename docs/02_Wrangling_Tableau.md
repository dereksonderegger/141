# Tableau Toolbox

Tableau comes with two pieces of software, `Tableau Prep` and `Tableau`. The prep software is intended to support the data tidying, cleaning, and summarization steps. Then we save the result to a file and open the cleaned up data in Tableau to do the visualization. 

This course has access to both Tableau and Tableau Prep through an academic license. 

1. Go to [https://www.tableau.com/products/prep/download](https://www.tableau.com/products/prep/download) to download both products.
2. Select each product download link to get started. When prompted, enter your school email address for Business E-mail and enter the name of your school for Organization.
3. Activate with your product key which will be distributed via email or on Bblearn.

This license will work through the semester. You may continue using Tableau after the class is over by individually requesting their own one-year license through the [Tableau for Students](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students) program.

## Importing data
Often data will be stored in a Comma Separated Values file that has a `.csv` file suffix. These types of files store data tables, and use a comma to separate the columns. Spreadsheet programs will recognize these files and show columns for `Student Name`, `Exam 1`, `Exam 2` and the `Final Exam`. However, if you open these files using a text reader program, they'll look something like this:


```r
Student Name,Exam 1,Exam 2,Final Exam
Alice,87,87,81
Bob,91,88,85
Charlie,88,79,92
```

Below is a video showing how to open up this same data in Tableau Prep.
