The usual map of the world that is shown is highly misleading. Because we have to project a spherical object onto a 2-D plane, we can't do it without distorting the areas. The result is that areas near the north and south poles look much larger than they actually are. This ends up emphasizing high latitude European countries compared to equatorial countries.

Here are the three most commonly used projections:
Equirectangular has an even grid of latitude and logitude lines.

The Robinson projection is a compromise that tries to re-scale land near the poles to be closer to the actual size.

Another compromise is to allow for discontinuities on the map surface. This decreases the amount of distortion, but cleaves Greenland and Antarctica.

I haven't had an opportunity to place my own spin on geographic maps and instead we will look at Claus Wilke's Chapter on [Geographic maps](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/geospatial-data.html).

I have a Tableau Tutorial planned as well.
