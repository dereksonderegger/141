# Critiques!




1. 90 Years of Gender Inequality in Canadian Politics (1930-2019). 
    a) Deputies are elected members of the House of Commons.
    b) Ministers are similar to the US Cabinet members. These are senior members of the ruling party and each Minister is also a House of Commons Deputy.
    c) <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NFLNhMsbvw4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    d) What do the dots represent? 
        i) A person, a seat? 
        ii) Why do the dots turn black and then fall out? Why do new dots show up?
    e) What could help this video? 
        i) Are dots the right choice? 
        ii) What about a pie chart over time?
        
2. Scrollytelling! The Gates Foundations 2019 Report.
    a) https://www.gatesfoundation.org/goalkeepers/report/2019-report/#ExaminingInequality
    b) Initial graphic sets the stage, and indirectly the order of discussion. Font sets the tone that this is not data, but rather an idealized visualization.
    c) Scrollytelling is the zooming.
    d) Annotation on demand!
    
3. More Scrollytelling!  Again we are zooming out to a wider and wider perspective.
    a) https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/06/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-policies-taxes.html
    b) The adding of dots is pretty cool.
    
3. Fonts indicating uncertainty (This is a pretty new idea!)
    a) Washington Post [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trifecta/)
    b) Races that are considered competitive are circled in a handwriting font to indicate that the notion of "competitive" is subjective.
    c) A [journal article](https://tobias.isenberg.cc/personal/papers/Wood_2012_SRI.pdf) about "sketchiness" as a visual attribute of a graph mark.
    d) Do you think a gradient scale of sketchiness would work? Or is it a binary on/off stylistic choice?
    e) Not widely available in graphing packages.

4. Other Methods for indicating variability
    a) Background distribution. 
        i) [Flowing Data - Time Spent](https://flowingdata.com/2016/12/06/how-people-like-you-spend-their-time/)
        ii) [Flowing Data - Firsts!](https://flowingdata.com/2017/02/23/the-first-time/)
    b) Error Bars / Error Ribbons
        i) [Supreme Court Justices](https://i.redd.it/tbkdkwgxgmy31.png)
        ii) [Donald Trumps Approval Rating](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo)

2. Historical Graphs
    a) In London 1854, the physician [John Snow](https://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2017/03/a-legacy-of-disease-detectives/) stopped a cholera outbreak by keeping careful records of deaths by cholera and [mapped them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow#/media/File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg). As a result of this map, and the death of a person who had stopped near the neighborhood and like the taste of water from a particular well, he identified the well as the source of the outbreak and removed the well pump handle.  It would eventually turn out that the well was contaminated by a old cesspit, only 3 feet away.
    b) Florence Nightingale kept detailed records about deaths in a military hospital during the Crimean War (1854) and believed that the conditions of the hospital were partly to blame for the death of 4077 soldiers (10 times more died from disease than from their wounds). Her [coxcomb graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale#/media/File:Nightingale-mortality.jpg) helped show the change in mortality after a sanitation commission flushed out the sewers and improved ventilation. Also in that same time, Nightingale implemented handwashing and other hygiene practices to the hospital.
    c) The space shuttle *Challenger* exploded due to o-rings not sealing the rocket boosters. Engineers working on the launch warned that due to the cold weather predicted on launch day, there could be an issue. However, they presented their worries in a table of data, and their warnings were ignored.  Would a [scatterplot](https://vizdatar.wordpress.com/2015/05/06/space-shuttle-challenger-explosion-2/) have changed the decision to fly that morning?
    


## Final Projects

1. Pick a DataVis of the month from [reddit/r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/search?q=author%3AAutoModerator+title%3A%22Battle+for+the+month+of%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on) 
2. Pick several submissions and do a critique of them.  Pick at least one bad submission, two mediocre submissions that you can say both good and bad things about, at least one very good submission. 
3. Create a comprehensive story, creating at least 3 graphics, that a reader would be able to follow. This info-graphic should be for mass consumption among adults, so pay attention to good annotation and labeling.
4. Create a report that describes your process of and the issues that you encountered and how you overcame them, design choices you wrestled with, and revision process you used to simplify your final product.
