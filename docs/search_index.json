Sonderegger January 12, 2020 Preface These are the lecture notes for STA 141 - Exploratory Visual Data Analysis. This course is intended to teach students how to think critically about problems, examine data that can provide answers, and create graphs that are insightful, and ask follow-up questions to the visual analysis. Also, because disinformation can be disguised to seem credible, students will also be exposed to various data visualization tricks and statistical malarkey that propagandists. The source code for my notes, homework assignments, and other information is available on my on GitHub. In particular, there is a directory data-raw that contains all of the datasets that we’ll use in these notes and homeworks. 0.1 Instructional Material This course draws information from several websites and books. Alberto Cairo’s book The Truthful Art. Alberto Cairo is the Knight Chair in Visual Journalism at the School of Communication of the University of Miami (UM), where he heads specializations in infographics and data visualization. You can find more about him at thefunctionalart.com. Also at his website, his blog highlights data visualizations in the news. Many of the graphs I will shown in this class are featured here. Claus O. Wilke has a book Fundamentals of Data Visualization. There is an online pre-print version of the book available here as well as GitHub repositories for the book source and data used in the book. He also has a nice R package called cowplot that aids in making publication ready graphs using R’s ggplot2. Calling Bullshit This is a 3-credit course taught at University of Washington. Their goal is to teach students to recognize bullshit provide another scientist a reason why a claim is bullshit. Amelia McNamara’s SDS 136 course. Amelia is an Assistant Professor at University of St Thomas and I’ve been influenced by her presentations at national conferences. These are her notes from a data visualization course that she teaches. She is also pretty fun to follow on twitter. 0.2 Data Sources The website Our World in Data has tried to bring together huge amounts of information about a variety of topics and presents the data in context. It typically addresses socioeconomic issues. The website Kaggle started out as a repository for data sets in which data scientists would have host informal competitions. It has grown to host thousands of data sets covering a wide variety of issues. The Gapminder website has health and socioeconomic data for counties going back in time. Access data from the US Government from Data.gov The Centers for Disease Control Vital Stats allows for direct download of commonly used downloads. The CDC’s Wonder on-line access allows you to format data requests for a wide variety of scenarios. 0.3 Introduction Why visualize data? See relationships that raw data obscure. Cognitive work to translate raw numbers into context between other data points are already done for you. Good graphics translate particular numerical relationships into physical relationships which our brains are really good at processing. UK Drug Poison These are the data from the UK related to drug overdose and misuse. Farther down the page gives a similar graph on suicide. Migration Patterns in Europe. While the New York Times is generally really quite good, this graph is quite misleading. Another view of the data is more fair, although the still depressing. I feel compelled to show a bad 3-d Excel graphic as well. Reuter’s infamous gun deaths in Florida chart. 0.4 Pedigogical Plan Develop basic understanding and skills about data wrangling. Because this course will require you to find data that interests you, we need to also learn how to manipulate it because the data are never in a nice format. Introduce the Elementary Perceptual Task order and understand how certain visual tasks are more accurate than others. Introduce a slew of graphic types and examples of where and how they are commonly used. Investigate the choice of variables to display and how that can influence the graph interpretation. Understand how interactive graphics can be used across a broad audience. "],

However this isn’t completely true. The process can be thought of as having four distinct steps. Step Description Import Get the data into software somehow. The structure of the data is just however it came in. Tidy Restructure the data so that each row is an observation, and each column is a variable. Clean Correct variable types, consistent and useful labels, validation and correction. Use Sub-setting the full data into a smaller set that addresses a particular question. In many real world examples, the data wrangling work is concentrated in only one first three steps. Typically you might be able to skip one or more steps, but pedagogically it is helpful to 1.2 Tidying The terminology of “tidy data” popularized by Hadley Wickham and his introduction to the concept lives in a vignette in the R tidyr package. I highly recommend reading Hadley Wickhams’s introduction as well as what I present here. Data is usually described as “tidy” if it satisfies the following: Each row represents an observation. Each column represents a variable. Each table of data represents a different type of observational unit. The difficult part is recognizing what constitutes an observation and what constitutes a variable. Often I like to think that the observations represent a noun and each now has multiple variables that adjectives that describe the noun. In particular I think that the attributes should be applicable to every single observation. If your data has a large number of NA values, that is a symptom of storing the data in a messy (non-tidy) format. Suppose I have an address book where I keep email addresses, phone numbers, and other contact information. However, because different people have several different types of contact information, it would be a bad idea to have one row per person because then we’d need a column for work email, personal email, home phone, work phone, cell phone, twitter handle, reddit user name, etc. Instead, store the information with a single row representing a particular contact. ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## Person Type Value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Derek Work Email derek.sonderegger@nau.edu ## 2 Derek Cell Phone 970-867-5309 ## 3 Derek Twitter @D_Sonderegger ## 4 Derek Github dereksonderegger ## 5 Mom Home Phone 555-867-5309 For a more challenging example, suppose we have grade book where we’ve stored students scores for four different homework assignments. ## name HW.1 HW.2 HW.3 HW.4 ## 1 Alison 8 5 8 4 ## 2 Brandon 5 3 6 9 ## 3 Charles 9 7 9 10 In this case we are considering each row to represent a student and each variable represents homework score. An alternative representation would be for each row to represent a single score. ## name Assignment Score ## 1 Alison HW.1 8 ## 2 Brandon HW.1 5 ## 3 Charles HW.1 9 ## 4 Alison HW.2 5 ## 5 Brandon HW.2 3 ## 6 Charles HW.2 7 ## 7 Alison HW.3 8 ## 8 Brandon HW.3 6 ## 9 Charles HW.3 9 ## 10 Alison HW.4 4 ## 11 Brandon HW.4 9 ## 12 Charles HW.4 10 Either representation is fine in this case, because each student should have the same number of assignments. However, if I was combining grade books from multiple times I’ve taught the course, the first option won’t work because sometimes I assign projects and sometimes not. So the tidy version of the data would be to have a table scores where each row represents a single assignment from a particular student. 1.3 Cleaning The cleaning step is usually highly dependent on the data set content. This step involves Making sure every variable has the right type. For example, make sure that dates are dates, not character strings. Fix factor labels and sort order. Verify numeric values are reasonable. Create (some) calculated variables Most of our data frame manipulation tools are designed to work with tidy data. As a result, cleaning is most easily done after the data set structure has been tidied. Therefore,I recommend first performing the reshaping tidying step and then perform the cleaning. 1.4 Use In this step, we concentrate on the research question of interest. Often this involves calculating summary statistics, calculating selecting only particular rows of data, and finally creating graphs and models. "],
["2-tableau-toolbox.html", "Chapter 2 Tableau Toolbox 2.1 Importing data 2.2 Tidying or Reshaping 2.3 Cleaning 2.4 Use Cases", " Chapter 2 Tableau Toolbox Tableau comes with two pieces of software, Tableau Prep and Tableau. The prep software is intended to support the data tidying, cleaning, and summarization steps. Then we save the result to a file and open the cleaned up data in Tableau to do the visualization. This course has access to both Tableau and Tableau Prep through an academic license. Go to https://www.tableau.com/products/prep/download to download both products. Select each product download link to get started. When prompted, enter your school email address for Business E-mail and enter the name of your school for Organization. Activate with your product key which will be distributed via email or on Bblearn. This license will work through the semester. You may continue using Tableau after the class is over by individually requesting their own one-year license through the Tableau for Students program. 2.1 Importing data Often data will be stored in a Comma Separated Values file that has a .csv file suffix. These types of files store data tables, and use a comma to separate the columns. Spreadsheet programs will recognize these files and show columns for Student Name, Exam 1, Exam 2 and the Final Exam. However, if you open these files using a text reader program, they’ll look something like this: Student Name,Exam 1,Exam 2,Final Exam Alice,87,87,81 Bob,91,88,85 Charlie,88,79,92 Below is a video showing how to open up this same data in Tableau Prep. 2.2 Tidying or Reshaping 2.2.1 Gather 2.2.2 Spread 2.2.3 Column Splitting 2.3 Cleaning 2.3.1 Column Types 1.
