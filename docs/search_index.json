Sonderegger September 03, 2019 Preface These are the lecture notes for STA 141 - Exploratory Visual Data Analysis. This course is intended to teach students how to think critically about problems, examine data that can provide answers, and create graphs that are insightful, and ask follow-up questions to the visual analysis. Also, because disinformation can be disguised to seem credible, students will also be exposed to various data visualization tricks and statistical malarky that propagandists. This course draws information from several websites and books. Alberto Cairo’s book The Truthful Art. Alberto Cairo is the Knight Chair in Visual Journalism at the School of Communication of the University of Miami (UM), where he heads specializations in infographics and data visualization. You can find more about him at thefunctionalart.com. Also at his website, his blog highlights data visualizations in the news. Many of the graphs I will shown in this class are featured here. Claus O. Wilke has a book Fundamentals of Data Visualization. There is an online pre-print version of the book available here. He also has a nice R package called cowplot that aids in making publication ready graphs using R’s ggplot2. Calling Bullshit This is a 3-credit course taught at Univeristy of Washington. Their goal is to teach students to recognize bullshit provide another scientist a reason why a claim is bullshit. Amelia McNamara’s SDS 136 course. Amelia is an Assistant Professor at University of St Thomas and I’ve been influenced by her presentations at national conferences. These are her notes from a data visulization course that she teaches. She is also pretty fun to follow on twitter. "]
