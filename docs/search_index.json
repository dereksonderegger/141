As a result of this map, and the death of a person who had stopped near the neighborhood and like the taste of water from a particular well, he identified the well as the source of the outbreak and removed the well pump handle. It would eventually turn out that the well was contaminated by a old cesspit, only 3 feet away.

Also in that same time, Nightingale implemented handwashing and other hygiene practices to the hospital. The space shuttle Challenger exploded due to o-rings not sealing the rocket boosters. Engineers working on the launch warned that due to the cold weather predicted on launch day, there could be an issue.
