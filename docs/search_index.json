Sonderegger August 27, 2019 Preface These are the lecture notes for STA 141 - Exploratory Visual Data Analysis. This course is intended to teach students how to think critically about problems, examine data that can provide answers, and create graphs that are insightful, and ask follow-up questions to the visual analysis. Also, because disinformation can be disguised to seem credible, students will also be exposed to various data visualization tricks and statistical malarky that propagandists. This course draws information from several websites and books. Alberto Cairo’s book The Truthful Art. Alberto Cairo is the Knight Chair in Visual Journalism at the School of Communication of the University of Miami (UM), where he heads specializations in infographics and data visualization. You can find more about him at thefunctionalart.com. Also at his website, his blog highlights data visualizations in the news. Many of the graphs I will shown in this class are featured here. Claus O. Wilke has a book Fundamentals of Data Visualization. He also has a nice R package called cowplot that aids in making publication ready graphs using R’s ggplot2. Calling Bullshit This is a 3-credit course taught at Univeristy of Washington. Their goal is to teach students to recognize bullshit provide another scientist a reason why a claim is bullshit. Amelia McNamara’s SDS 136 course. Amelia is an Assistant Professor at University of St Thomas and I’ve been influenced by her presentations at national conferences. These are her notes from a data visulization course that she teaches. She is also pretty fun to follow on twitter. "],

Why visualize it? See relationships that raw data obscure. Cognative work to translate raw numbers into context between other data points are already done for you. Good graphics translate particular numerical relationships into physical relationships which our brains are really good at processing. 1.2 Amazing Graphics UK Drug Poison These are the data from the UK related to drug overdose and misuse. Farther down the page gives a similar graph on suicide. Migration Patterns in Europe. 1.3 Bad Graphs While the New York Times is generally really quite good, this graph is quite misleading. Another view of the data is more fair, although the still depressing. I feel compelled to show a bad 3-d Excel graphic as well. Reuter’s infamous gun deaths in Florida chart. An amusing case where a pie chart is ridiculous. This is the result of a survey that asks what pizza toppings are liked. In particular, a person can pick more than one topping and so the percentages don’t sum to 100%. 1.4 Tableau or ??? Tableau is a nice program that reads in data and can produce some very nice graphics and dashboards. Licensing Questions? What are dashboards? A series of related graphs, often with controls that allow you to explore the data. Britian’s Coal Use 2015-2019 "],
["2-elementary-percepual-tasks.html", "Chapter 2 Elementary Percepual Tasks 2.1 Groupings 2.2 “Color” Scales", " Chapter 2 Elementary Percepual Tasks Some Visual tasks are easier than others. From Alberto Cairo’s “The Truthful Art” From Hadley Wickham’s Stat 405 at Rice. (Slides 34 - 40) Effective Visualizations 2.1 Groupings The way we organize our graphics can lead a viewer to create mental groups of marks. Winona State’s Data Visualization PowerPoint Slides 30-50 Enclosures Connections Proximity Similarity (color/shape) Example: Warpbreaks While spinning wool into thread, if the tension on the wool isn’t correctly set, the thread can break. Here we compare two different types of wool at three different tensions. 2.2 “Color” Scales Defining Color really has three different attributes (From Wikipedia). 2.2.1 HSV Scale Hue: The attribute of a visual sensation according to which an area appears to be similar to one of the perceived colors: red, yellow, green, and blue, or to a combination of two of them. Saturation: The “colorfulness of a stimulus relative to its own brightness” Value: The “brightness relative to the brightness of a similarly illuminated white” HSV Cylinder Hue is appropriate for categorical variables. Saturation and/or Value is approriate for a quantitative variable scale. Neither R nor Tableau make it particularly easy to map these aspects, so we won’t get too deep into it. "]
