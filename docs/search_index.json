Sonderegger September 08, 2019 Preface These are the lecture notes for STA 141 - Exploratory Visual Data Analysis. This course is intended to teach students how to think critically about problems, examine data that can provide answers, and create graphs that are insightful, and ask follow-up questions to the visual analysis. Also, because disinformation can be disguised to seem credible, students will also be exposed to various data visualization tricks and statistical malarky that propagandists. This course draws information from several websites and books. Alberto Cairo’s book The Truthful Art. Alberto Cairo is the Knight Chair in Visual Journalism at the School of Communication of the University of Miami (UM), where he heads specializations in infographics and data visualization. You can find more about him at thefunctionalart.com. Also at his website, his blog highlights data visualizations in the news. Many of the graphs I will shown in this class are featured here. Claus O. Wilke has a book Fundamentals of Data Visualization. There is an online pre-print version of the book available here and an R package for the data used in the book is available here. He also has a nice R package called cowplot that aids in making publication ready graphs using R’s ggplot2. Calling Bullshit This is a 3-credit course taught at Univeristy of Washington. Their goal is to teach students to recognize bullshit provide another scientist a reason why a claim is bullshit. Amelia McNamara’s SDS 136 course. Amelia is an Assistant Professor at University of St Thomas and I’ve been influenced by her presentations at national conferences. These are her notes from a data visulization course that she teaches. She is also pretty fun to follow on twitter. "],

See relationships that raw data obscure. Cognative work to translate raw numbers into context between other data points are already done for you. Good graphics translate particular numerical relationships into physical relationships which our brains are really good at processing. 1.1.2 Amazing Graphics UK Drug Poison These are the data from the UK related to drug overdose and misuse. Farther down the page gives a similar graph on suicide. Migration Patterns in Europe. 1.1.3 Bad Graphs While the New York Times is generally really quite good, this graph is quite misleading. Another view of the data is more fair, although the still depressing. I feel compelled to show a bad 3-d Excel graphic as well. Reuter’s infamous gun deaths in Florida chart. An amusing case where a pie chart is ridiculous. This is the result of a survey that asks what pizza toppings are liked. In particular, a person can pick more than one topping and so the percentages don’t sum to 100%. 1.1.4 Tableau or ??? Tableau is a nice program that reads in data and can produce some very nice graphics and dashboards. Licensing Questions? What are dashboards? A series of related graphs, often with controls that allow you to explore the data. Britian’s Coal Use 2015-2019 1.2 EPTs and Gestalt Some Visual tasks are easier than others. From Alberto Cairo’s “The Truthful Art” From Hadley Wickham’s Stat 405 at Rice. (Slides 34 - 40) Effective Visualizations 1.2.1 Groupings / Gestalt The way we organize our graphics can lead a viewer to create mental groups of marks. Winona State’s Data Visualization PowerPoint Slides 30-50 Enclosures Connections Proximity Similarity (color/shape) Example: Warpbreaks While spinning wool into thread, if the tension on the wool isn’t correctly set, the thread can break. Here we compare two different types of wool at three different tensions. 1.2.2 “Color” Scales Defining Color really has three different attributes (From Wikipedia). 1.2.2.1 HSV Scale Hue: The attribute of a visual sensation according to which an area appears to be similar to one of the perceived colors: red, yellow, green, and blue, or to a combination of two of them. Saturation: The “colorfulness of a stimulus relative to its own brightness” Value: The “brightness relative to the brightness of a similarly illuminated white” HSV Cylinder from Wikipedia Hue is appropriate for categorical variables. Saturation and/or Value is approriate for a quantitative variable scale. Neither R nor Tableau make it particularly easy to map these aspects, so we won’t get too deep into it. 1.3 Practicum #1 1.3.1 How to Store Data Data is commonly stored in spreadsheets. Columns are variables of interest Rows are observations. Example: A dataset we’ll call iris which has 150 observations of three species of iris. Each observation measured the length and width of both the petals and sepals. Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.9 3 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa 5 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa Example: A dataset we’ll call GradeBook that has records of how well a student performed on exams. I’ll refer to this storage as the wide orientation.

["2-week-2.html", "Chapter 2 Week 2 2.1 Amounts 2.2 Distributions 2.3 Proportions", " Chapter 2 Week 2 Assignments Read Chapter 6 and 7 from Claus Wilke’s Fundamentals of Data Visualiztion book. Watch Hans Roslings TED talk. Comment on two aspects of the videa that stand out to you regarding how he presented his data and how he talked through the visualization with the audience. Graph the NOAA CO\\(_2\\) data over time. The Nationa Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration has monthly CO\\(_2\\) atmospheric levels data available to the public at NOAA’s website. However, this is a little obnoxious to get into Tableau, so I’ve done some data wrangling for you already. The Date2 column has the date information encoded using a continuous decimal scale. CO\\(_2\\) is measured in parts per million. Plot CO\\(_2\\) over time while showing the monthly trend. Should we use area or lines? Why? Create a graph that shows a single mark per year (so average over all observations in a year). Do you like this better? Explain your reasoning. Create a follow-up graphic that shows the monthly trend. Explain what you want to demonstrate and why you chose to display the information as you did. 2.1 Amounts The 2020 presidential candidate field has a wide range of ages. The New York Times has a nice article showing the candidate ages. I grabbed a few of the most prominent candidates and pulled their birthdays from Wikipedia and then calculated their age on election day. The order of the candidates is useless. Here we have ordered them alphabetically when we should try to think about an ordering that improves clarity. Lets switch to sorting the candidates by age. This isn’t too bad, but it fails to visually impress the differences. A bar chart should visually impress the ages based on the length of the bar so that we con’t have to keep looking at the Age axis. What would be dishonest is if we were to chop off the bars at 35 or 40 to make the age difference between Buttigieg and Warren, Trump, Biden and Sanders seem huge. Often we need to graph some value and want to know how it varies among two different categories. In these cases, we have to employ some sort of grouping strategy. The bar chart here is obscuring the differences in life expectancies because the numbers are so close. In this case, I think points make more sense. Also I want to see how life expectancy has changed since World War II. In the above graph, I am grouping countries both by enclosure and with a physical path connection. The reader tends to see the line as a whole object and compare the line max/min and slope among the seven countries. We might consider changing the faceting to stack the countries, but this makes it much harder to compare countries to see which has a higher life expectancy. A heat map makes it easier to see which country has the highest life expectancy, but we lose precision in the actual values. 2.2 Distributions Given a single variable, I often want to know what values are common and what values are rare. To visualize this, we will primarily compare marks along a common axis (the most accurate EPT!) 2.2.1 Small samples If we only have a few observations, then we can just graph them along an axis. Another trick that works with more data, is to not use dots but rather lines. This is called a rugplot. This is often used in conjunction with another graph such as a scatterplot. 2.2.2 Histograms When we have a moderate size of data, graphing dots exactly on an axis doesn’t work and results in overplotting and it is difficult to see where the data cluster. Instead we’ll stack the dots in columns along the axis and call this a dotplot. Each dot represents an observation, but the x-values have been rounded into group values. So we have lost some precision. Another common version of this is a histogram, where the y-axis represents how many observations fall into each bin. The choice of how many bins to include can make a dramatic difference in a graph. In particular, I don’t believe that there is any biological reason to think the dip near 2700 grams is real. I believe that is is actually just an artifact of the data I have. Instead we should consider changing the number of bins. 2.2.3 Density plots Histograms suffer from being to angular or pointy. Another solution is call a kernel density smoother that mathematically smooths over the heights of the histogram bars. 2.2.4 Faceting One of my favorite ways to display multiple distributions is to group each distribution into it’s own plot in a process often referred to as faceting. By choosing to put the two graphs on top of the other, it becomes clear that the smoker’s tend to give birth to smaller infants. This fact isn’t clear in the side-by-side graphs. 2.2.5 Stacking Stacking the distribution involes laying each distribution on top of each other, so that the zero of the top curve follows the curve on the bottom. You can visualize the B chart having the Non-smoker density graph just melt onto the smoker density. I really don’t like this graph because it is very hard to see where the peak of the non-smoker curve is. This stacking trick works well enough when we have proportions but isn’t good here. 2.2.6 Overlapping curves Another option is to graph the densities, but allow them to overlap each other and be a bit see-thru. For seeing shifts in the center of the distribution, overlapping curves is quite powerful. For another nice example, we can look at the density of the daily maximum temperature in Lincoln Nebraska in 2016. 2.2.7 Boxplots Boxplots are a traditional way to display a distribution and the box contains the middle 50% of the data points. Notice that in density plots, there were two peaks in December with the lower peak corresponding to a cold snap. However that detail is lost in the boxplots. 2.2.8 Violin Plots Boxplots are a traditional way to display a distribution and the box contains the middle 50% of the data points. Now we can see the two peaks in December, but the three peaks in November have been flattened out because the amount of space necessary to show it would require that the densities overlap. 2.3 Proportions A good pie chart from reddit/r/dataisbeautiful member u/foiltape. A Good Pie Chart "],
["3-week-3.html", "Chapter 3 Week 3 3.1 Proportions 3.2 Multiple Sets of Proportions 3.3 Exercises", " Chapter 3 Week 3 3.1 Proportions Conceptually graphing proportions is the same as graph raw values, but sum to 100%. This seemingly small difference means that our graphic can imply that our categories contain ALL possible categories. 3.1.1 Pie Charts As typical, with a just a few categories, we should move the labels onto the graph and just annotate the graph. Also, we’ll order the categories from the most temperary employees (instructors) to most permanent (professors) 3.1.2 Stacked Bar 3.1.3 Side-by-side Barchart Pie chart Stacked bars Side-by-side bars Clear that data is proportions of a whole Yes Yes no Precise visual comparison of values no no Yes Visually appealing even in simple comparisons Yes no Yes Extendable to nested or multiple distributions or time series no Yes no 3.2 Multiple Sets of Proportions 3.2.1 Faceted Bar charts 3.2.2 Side-by-Side Stacked Barcharts 3.2.3 Mosiac plots Sort like side-by-side stacked bar charts, but now we allow the column width to vary as well. The area is proportional the groups representation in the whole data. This reduces the number of really thin bands because we can make the column narrower as well. 3.2.4 Alluvial Plots If we want to compare multiple categorical variables, another option is alluvial plots. I find that alluvial plots work better for events that have a definate chronological order and there is less stream overlaps.. Here is an example from a Washington Post story about people graphing their online dating interactions. These are the results of 6.5 weeks of online dating by a 37 year old woman. 3.2.5 Tree graphs When we have a hierarchical structure of categories, then mosaic plots aren’t quite right. Instead we’ll hierarchically subdivide the graph area up. The graph first separates the graph into continents and scales the area of each continent by the population of the continent. Then each continent is split into the countries that compose the continent, again with area representing population. Finally the countries are color-coded by their 2007 life expectancy. This differs from a moasic plot in that a country only occurs withing one continent whereas in a mosaic plot, a category level will occur in multiple “containers”. 3.3 Exercises Alluvial plots are a particular type of Sankey graphs which show flow rates and amounts and have been around for quite some time. In 1869, Charles Minard created a graphic that details the size of Napaleon’s army as they marched on Russia and subsequently returned. You can find the original or the modern English translation on Wikipedia. How many men did the army start marching with? How many men arrived in Moscow? How many men died crossing the Berezina River on the return trip? (approximately from the map information provided) How cold was it when they cross the Berezina River on the retern trip? Read Chapter 10 and 11 in Claus Wilke’s Fundamentals of Data Visualiztion book. In chapter 10 he presents several different graphics that visualize the bridge construction era, bridge material, and which river they cross for bridges near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Discuss three of them and explain which graph you prefer and why. Download data about the Titanic disaster at the GitHub site for this class. Save the file as a Titanic.csv and open it in Tableau. In Tableau, a faceted stacked barchart just as we did in these notes. In a new worksheet, copy your faceted stacked barchart and then turn it into faceted pie charts. Comment on which you prefer and why. Finally create a mosaic plot of the Titatic dataset. "]
